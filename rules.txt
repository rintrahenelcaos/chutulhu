Use chits or miniatures to represent units.

FACTIONS
Each player picks one Faction.
Each Faction has its own set of units described in its own unit list.
Each Faction has its own cardset described in its own cardset list.
There are 8 Factions:
Human Investigators
Deep Ones
Humanoids
Yithians
Elder Things
Mi-Go
Serpent People
Cultists

SPELL DECK
Players share a common Spell Deck.
Only leaders can use spells.
Keep your spell cards in a Separate hand.

SETUP
Each player places one unit on each square of his back two rows.
Units may not stack. 

TURN SEQUENCE
Players take turns. 
Each turn has 3 phases:
1. Fate Phase
2. Move Phase
3. Attack Phase

FATE PHASE
Draw 3 cards from your deck. 
Max hand size = 5 cards.
If the deck runs out, shuffle the discard and draw from it.
Discard excess cards.

MOVE PHASE
Play (discard) a Move card to move one of your units.
The move card has a number. 
This is the number of spaces the unit moves.
Moves can be diagonal or orthogonal. 
“Knight” type move cards allow a unit to move like a knight in chess.
Instead of moving just one unit in any direction, you have the 
option of moving one or more units forward the indicated number of 
spaces using a single move card.

ATTACK PHASE
Play (discard) an Attack card to have a unit attack.
The attack card has a number. 
This is the range of the attack.
Attacks can be diagonal or orthogonal. 
“Knight” type attack cards produce an attack with a range like a knight in chess.
Attacks always do one Hit of damage to the target unless otherwise specified.
Use Chits or coins to record damage.
A unit reduced to zero Hits is killed and removed from the board.
Your opponent may play Defense cards to negate your attack.

UNIT TABLE NOMENCLATURE
